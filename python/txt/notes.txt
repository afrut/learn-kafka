Using confluent-kafka's Producer, do you need to call producer.poll()?
confluent_kafka is built on librdkafka. In librdkafka, the producer has a
produce queue to batch messages. When this queue fills up, all messages are sent
to the broker. Calling producer.poll() enables the developer to send the
messages in the batch even when the queue is not full.
    - Run a consumer: python consumerSimple.py
    - Produce 10 records without polling and observe that the consumer does not receive anything
        - python producerSimple.py --num_records 10
    - Produce 10000 records without polling and observe that the consumer receives messages
        - python producerSimple.py --num_records 10000
    - Produce 10 records with polling and observe that the consumer receives messages
        - python producerSimple.py --num_records 10 --poll
